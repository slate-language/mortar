// A document, for the half of this package that has one.
//
//     npm install
//     NODE_OPTIONS="--import ./tests-dom/setup.mjs" slate test --js tests-dom
//
// **`slate test --js` writes the whole suite into one file and runs `node` on it**, so there is
// nowhere to put a `<script>` and no page to load. `--import` is the seam: node runs this module
// before the program, and slate's runtime takes the page off `globalThis.document` -- once, at the
// top of its own module -- so a document that is there by then is the document the suite renders
// into.
//
// **jsdom rather than a fake document written beside the code it checks, and that is the point.** A
// shim written here would agree with `dom.slx` by construction: every mistake this package, or
// slate's own `js_rt_dom.sysl`, could make about what `setAttribute`, `replaceChildren` or
// `addEventListener` do, the shim would make too, and the run would pass. jsdom is somebody else's
// reading of the same specification and is free to disagree. It is how `mounted` was found.
//
// ## The three things a slate test cannot do, and how they are handed to it
//
// **`slate:dom` is twenty-eight names, and none of them dispatches an event, observes a mutation or
// counts what the browser refused to do.** A slate program has no way to reach a JavaScript global
// -- a builtin is a parameter of the emitted program, not a name taken off `globalThis` -- so those
// three have to arrive through names `slate:dom` already has. They do:
//
// - **`setProperty(node, "lathEvent", spec)` dispatches a real event on that node.** A property
//   assignment on an element is exactly what `setProperty` is, and the setter installed below is an
//   ordinary accessor on `Element.prototype`. `spec` is the type and then the modifiers:
//   `"click"`, `"click meta"`, `"click button=1"`, `"keydown key=Enter"`. jsdom builds the event and
//   jsdom dispatches it; nothing here decides what a click means.
// - **`attribute(byId("lath-probe"), "data-mutations")` is a `MutationObserver`'s count.** The
//   observer watches `document.body`, and the element it writes its count on lives in the HEAD --
//   so publishing a count is not itself a mutation the count would see.
// - **`data-navigations` is how many clicks jsdom was allowed to follow.** jsdom raises
//   *"Not implemented: navigation to another Document"* when a click on an anchor is left alone, so
//   the count of those IS the count of links the router declined -- which is what says the refusals
//   were refusals and not a broken link.
//
// **Two names on `slate:dom` would replace all of it** -- a `dispatch(node, type, init)` and an
// `observe(node, fn)` -- and until they exist this is the seam. It does not fake anything: every
// answer above is jsdom's own.
